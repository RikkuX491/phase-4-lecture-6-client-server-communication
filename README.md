2. Make sure that you are in the correct directory (folder) that contains a `Pipfile`, then run `pipenv install` in your terminal to install the required Python libraries.

3. Now that your `pipenv` virtual environment is ready to use, enter `pipenv shell` to enter the virtual environment.

4. Run `npm install --prefix client` in your terminal to install the dependencies for the React app.

5. Enter the command `cd server` in the terminal to move into the server directory.
